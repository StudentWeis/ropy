# TODO

- Theme Toogle
- Support for multiple languages
- Log files
- Provide installation packages and distribution channels
- Support customizable shortcuts
- Support clipboard content categorization
- Provide detailed user documentation
- Support more platforms (Linux)

Windows Bugs:

- WeChat chat box crashes
- ShareX automatically copies twice
- Window cannot be dragged.

Bugs:

- After Clear, the listener should also be cleared, otherwise it will confuse users.

# NOT TODO

- Does not support obtaining the application source when copying (the system clipboard does not provide this field, requires Hack to obtain).
- Does not support plugin extension functionality (currently no plans to support plugin mechanism, Ropy aims to remain lightweight and simple).
- Does not support online synchronization of clipboard content (currently not considering cloud sync functionality).
- Does not support command-line operations (Ropy is mainly for GUI users, does not provide a command-line interface).
