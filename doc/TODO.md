# NOT TODO

- Does not support obtaining the application source when copying (the system clipboard does not provide this field, requires Hack to obtain).
- Does not support plugin extension functionality (currently no plans to support plugin mechanism, Ropy aims to remain lightweight and simple).
- Does not support online synchronization of clipboard content (currently not considering cloud sync functionality).
- Does not support command-line operations (Ropy is mainly for GUI users, does not provide a command-line interface).
